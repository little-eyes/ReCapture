\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this project, we design and implement an automatic evaluation tool and testbed for mobile system. Throughout the design, implementation and evaluation process, we think the ReCapture can now help researchers to evaluate their system work more easily by just configuring the ReCapture framework and let it run. However, the scalability of the ReCapture is linear with the number of devices. We are working on the virtualization technology which could break through the framework's scalability so that ReCapture could serve in large scale evaluation.
